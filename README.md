Someone tried to break into my house the other day. I'm pretty sure he turned into a bug when I opened the door.

One time I broke into a mansion to save someone screaming, it was a bird. someone ripped out the wooden floors next to a blood stained  movie viewing room where the bird was trapped.

That day I got bit by a cobra, fbi keeps hiding this pic so I don't expect you to be able to see it, dropped a knife in front of fbi hq that day after getting bit, tarantula later that night https://www.deviantart.com/tonightsonme/art/Screenshot-2023-05-06-233613-976833154

There are these animals around my neighborhood that learned to talk, my old dog charlie that passed last year used to talk too
